### IDEMPIERE DOCKER GRPC SERVER PLUGIN

This plugin is under development and is used for porting `adempiere-grpc-server` into `idempiere` system. This serves as a backend to `adempiere-vue`. There are four servers and there is need for envoy proxy to mediate between these multiple servers for frontend.
